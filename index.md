# About

<p align="justify">
I am an interdisciplinary researcher, currently based in Porto, Portugal, 
with a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. My expertise spans biomathematics, bioinformatics, 
population and forensic genetics, and computational biology. Over the past 15 years, 
I have focused on developing and applying quantitative models to study complex biological 
and health-related systems. For full details see my CV in dedicated tab.
</p>

# Academic & Professional Background

<p align="justify">
I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of 
Porto (FCUP) in 2012, specializing in algorithms for genetic kinship 
analysis. Currently, I am an Assistant Researcher at i3S – Instituto 
de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, University of Porto. My academic 
journey includes postdoctoral contracts fellowships, teaching appointments, 
and international research leadership.
</p>

# Research & Publications

<p align="justify">
I have authored 76 scientific works, including 48 research papers (43 
of which are in JCR Q1 journals), six book chapters, a book with CRC 
Press ("An Introduction to Forensic Genetics for Non-Geneticists"), and a 
variety of collaborative conference proceedings. My research addresses 
challenges in forensic genetics, genetic kinship, neurosciences, mutation 
data analysis, and computational approaches for biological data.
</p>

# Projects & Funding

<p align="justify">
I currently lead and participate in several international research projects:
•	PI for MultiAD and AgeAD (Portugal) – developing multimodal models for Alzheimer’s disease.
•	i3S Co-PI for Horizon Europe projects (CapCell, ForMat) – focused on forensic genomics and single-cell technologies.
•	i3S PI in a Marie Curie Network (Natural Traces) – investigating non-human forensic evidence.
</p>

# Teaching, Supervision & Leadership

<p align="justify">
I regularly deliver invited lectures, seminars, and workshops across Europe and Latin America. 
I supervise Ph.D. and MSc students in genetics, computational biology, and forensic science, and 
I coordinate international working groups leading large collaborative studies for the International 
Society for Forensic Genetics (ISFG).
</p>

# Collaboration & Recognition

<p align="justify">
My research collaborations include partners from more than 40 laboratories worldwide. I frequently 
coordinate and assess international commissions on population and forensic genetics, and I provide 
expertise in software validation, modelling, and standards development.
